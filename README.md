# Sub-Spy

Sub-Spy is a tool designed for conducting subdomain reconnaissance. This script searches for subdomains and geolocates possible IP addresses it discovers. It provides a quick way to gather information about domains.

## Usage

To use Sub-Spy, execute the following command:

```bash
./subspy [Domains]
```

This script is not entirely logless, if the target is using its own DNS servers, this script will generate a log about attempting to reversing the discovered subdomains.
